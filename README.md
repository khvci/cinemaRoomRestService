<h3>Let's buy the seat at first row, first column, which is available, by sending a post request to /purchase endpoint. If transaction is succesful,  it returns the seat and the price with 200 OK Http response:</h3>

<p><i>Update: now it also returns with a token, which will be used for returning tickets later.</i></p>
